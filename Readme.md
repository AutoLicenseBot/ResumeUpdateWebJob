## What is this?

This is an azure webjob to run on  the schedule at the beginning of the month to update my [resume](https://github.com/tparnell8/Resume).

Resume cli calculates everything at build time and so relative dates get out of wack as time passes (like how  long I have been at my current job, etc).
